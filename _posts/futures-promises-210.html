<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">Callbacks</a>, the abiliby to reference a code fragment and pass it as argument to to another function is very popular and its used throught the application layers. I can be blocking or non blocking(used for IO, event processing). In scala async callbacks are done using&nbsp;<strong>futures</strong> and futures were implemented in many of the frameworks build ontop of scala.</p>
<p>In scala 2.10 there is a new implementation of Futures and adds the implentation of Promises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goals of this new implemention are:</p>
<p>1. To have a single implenation of this functionality (not one per framework).</p>
<p>2. To make this implementaion efficient and composable.</p>
<p>3. To take advantage of scala's power to make futures a more powerfull tool.</p>
<p>So what are Futures &amp; Promises</p>
<p><strong>Futures</strong> - Read only. Placeholder that may hold the result of a computation or the exception in case of a failure. "It is in effect immutable" which means you can pass it around to other threads whithout fear of it getting corrupted.</p>
<p>Futures have hooks for the expected outcomes:</p>
<p>onComplete, onSuccess, onFailure</p>
<p>These callbacks are executed independently and without a specific order between them (at least in the default implementation).</p>
<p>You should be carefull with the amount of pending futures as they become available for garbage collection only once they are executed. So you should see a memory during the time a lot of them are pending.</p>
<p><strong>Promises</strong>&nbsp;- Writable once, scala framework takes care of this so you dont have to. A promise completes its future by providing the return value or the exception in case of failure. For a promise <strong>p</strong> the correcponding future is <strong>p.future</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use <strong>p success value</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>p failure exception</strong>&nbsp;to complete p.future. If the promise was already set, an exception is thrown, for that reason there are the <strong>p trySuccess value</strong> and <strong>p tryFailure exception</strong>&nbsp;methods which will complete the promise only it if is not already completed.</p>
