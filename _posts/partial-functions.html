<p>Partial functions are functions that are not defined for all possible input.</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>The main distinction between PartialFunction and scala.Function1 is that the user of a PartialFunction may choose to do something different with input that is declared to be outside its domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can pretty much use a PartialFunction anywhere you would use a Function1 since it is a proper subtype, plus some extras.</p>

<p>The <strong>applyOrElse</strong> function used last in the above example takes a regular function and applies that if the partial function is not defined at the argument. There is one more method <strong>orElse</strong> that takes a partial function and creates a partial function that is defined at the union of the 2 partial functions that generate it. It is equivalent to a <strong>case</strong> statement that combines the functions. Note here that the order also matters in case the ranges overlap.</p>
