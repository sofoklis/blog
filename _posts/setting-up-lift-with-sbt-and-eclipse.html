<p>To install simply add the following to the project/plugins.sbt and make sure you keep new lines between all the settings in your sbt files, you need to add the xsbt plugin to be able to run the container:start/stop commands and run your project</p>
<p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/1716027">https://gist.github.com/1716027</a></p></p>
<p>You can define new keys in project/Build.scala or any other .scala file under the project folder</p>
<p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/1716152">https://gist.github.com/1716152</a></p></p>
<p>in build.sbt add the following line, you need this to have library sources for all your dependencies and you can use your keys to fetch your dependencies:</p>
<p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/1716041">https://gist.github.com/1716041</a></p></p>
<p>after this is done you should be able to run <strong>sbt eclipse</strong>&nbsp;and it will generate the eclipse project files for you. If you already have the eclipse project remove it from your workspace and import it again after you execute <strong>sbt eclipse</strong>. You should be able to browse code in eclipse.</p>
<p>Compile your project:</p>
<p><strong>sbt compile</strong></p>
<p>run:</p>
<p><strong>sbt</strong></p>
<p><strong>container:start</strong></p>
<p><strong>container:stop</strong></p>
