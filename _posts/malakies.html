<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)">Callbacks</a>, the abiliby to reference a code fragment and pass it as argument to to another function is very popular and its used throught the application layers. I can be blocking or non blocking(used for IO, event processing). In scala async callbacks are done using&nbsp;<strong>futures</strong> and futures were implemented in many of the frameworks build ontop of scala.</p>
