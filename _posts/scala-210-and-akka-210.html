<p>First I tried to modify the akka example from typesafe to work with the new scala and akka versions, you can find the modyfied project <a href="https://github.com/sofoklis/akka-project-in-scala">here</a> (with eclipse plugin).</p>
<p>Changes I made were to fix compilation due to classes moved from Akka into scala concurent (SIP-14) and&nbsp;some changes so all 8 cores of my system will be working for a little more.</p>
<p>It was nice to see that all of them were on full capacity during the run, if you try it with 4 workers you can see that about 1/2 of the cpu capacity is not used.</p>
<p>Also I find usefull to use <strong>eclipse with-source=true</strong>&nbsp;in sbt to download the sources, makes browsing the code in eclipse a brease.</p>
