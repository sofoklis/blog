<p>I was just going through the messages in the lift web maillist and one of the posts was about the H2 dabase and how to view and edit the tables. I always wanted to have a look in there, but never bothered enough to figure it out. Thanks to Diego Medina for serving it on a plate!</p>
<p>Find where you h2 jar file is and then run the following command:</p>
<p>java -cp /path/to/h2/lib/h2-1.3.160.jar org.h2.tools.Server</p>
<p>This should start the server and it open up the browser for you:</p>
<p>Sellect generic h2 server from the first drop down then:</p>
<p>jdbc:h2:/path/to/db/startingdb;AUTO_SERVER=TRUE</p>
<p>Put the name without the ending ".h2.db" and then connect to your database. You should be able to view and edit your data. Pretty easy and very usefull!</p>
